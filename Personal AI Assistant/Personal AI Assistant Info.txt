Personal AI Assistant – Custom ChatGPT Interface with Memory
Use case: Self-built AI assistant for daily productivity
Tech: OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo | Memory via system prompt | Custom UI
Description:
To improve my daily work and avoid the limitations of the free ChatGPT interface, I created my own lightweight AI assistant powered by the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.
The goal was to build a persistent, cost-effective assistant that remembers context between chats and helps me with repetitive tasks — without relying on ChatGPT Plus or needing to rewrite the same prompts every day.
I achieved this by designing a minimal chat interface with a structured system prompt that simulates memory and customizes the assistant’s behavior to my personal workflow.
The assistant helps me with:
* Content creation and idea generation

* Social media writing for Rocket Mango

* Task planning and writing support

* Quick summaries and responses

No external tools or APIs were used — just a smart configuration of the OpenAI API.
This project reflects a practical and creative use of AI to improve productivity, reduce costs, and streamline solo work as a founder.


Highlights:
   * No-code/minimal-code setup

   * Persistent personality and memory simulation

   * Cost-efficient alternative to ChatGPT Plus

   * Fully personalized assistant tailored to my working style

   * Private and secure – no external integrations
