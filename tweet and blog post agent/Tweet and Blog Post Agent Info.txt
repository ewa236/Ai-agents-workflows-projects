Tweet and Blog Post Agent – AgentFlow Description
The Tweet and Blog Post Agent is an intelligent, multi-role automation flow designed to transform raw document-based knowledge into engaging, high-level content. It coordinates three specialized agents—Knowledge Explorer, Content Creator, and Data Organizer—to process, summarize, and publish information efficiently.


 Agent Roles & Workflow
1. Knowledge Explorer

   * Mission: Extract and organize insights from uploaded documents using the doc_reader tool.

   * Focus Areas: Identify core themes, trends, facts, and notable data points.

   * Output: A detailed and structured report summarizing the key findings from the documents.

      2. Content Creator

         * Mission: Convert the insights from the Knowledge Explorer into compelling public-facing content.

         * Tasks:

            * Write a well-structured, informative blog post.

            * Create 5 short, engaging tweets that highlight the blog's key insights.

               * Output: High-quality, shareable content tailored to the intended audience.

                  3. Data Organizer

                     * Mission: Ensure the accuracy, coherence, and long-term storage of all outputs.

                     * Tasks:

                        * Validate that the content aligns with the original insights.

                        * Summarize and structure the data for storage.

                        * Save the final output locally for easy retrieval.

                           * Output: A clean, well-organized package of the processed insights and content.



 Use Cases
                              * Automate content generation from research papers, reports, or technical documentation.

                              * Quickly convert internal knowledge into digestible formats for public distribution.
