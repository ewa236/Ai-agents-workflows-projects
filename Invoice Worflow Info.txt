Automated Invoice Processing Workflow (n8n)
This n8n workflow automates the process of handling new PDF invoices added to Google Drive. It extracts key data from the invoice, updates a Google Sheet with this information, and sends an email notification to the billing department.


 Workflow Overview
This workflow performs the following steps:
1. Trigger: Google Drive Watch

   * Monitors a specified folder in Google Drive.

   * Triggers when a new PDF invoice file is added.

      2. Extract Invoice Data

         * Uses the File Extractor node to read the contents of the PDF.

         * Sends the extracted text to the OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini model) to parse structured invoice data (e.g., invoice number, date, total, vendor).

            3. Update Google Sheets

               * Appends the extracted invoice data as a new row in a connected Google Sheet for centralized tracking.

                  4. Compose Email Notification

                     * Uses OpenAI API to generate a professional summary of the invoice.

                     * Prepares the email content with all relevant details.

                        5. Send Email

                           * Sends an email to the billing team with:

                              * A notification about the new invoice.

                              * A summary of the extracted invoice data.

                              * A link to the original PDF in Google Drive.

 Setup Instructions
To set up and use this workflow, follow these steps:
                                 1. Google Drive Integration

                                    * Create or select a specific folder in Google Drive for storing incoming invoices.

                                    * Set up Google Drive credentials in n8n.

                                    * Configure the “Google Drive Trigger” node to watch this folder for new .pdf files.

                                       2. OpenAI API Configuration

                                          * Create an account at platform.openai.com if you don't have one.

                                          * Obtain your OpenAI API key.

                                          * Add the OpenAI API credentials in n8n and select the GPT-4o-mini model in the relevant nodes.

                                             3. File Extraction

                                                * Ensure the "File Extractor" node is configured to handle PDF content extraction properly.

                                                * Pass the extracted text to the OpenAI node for data parsing.

                                                   4. Google Sheets Integration

                                                      * Create a Google Sheet with appropriate columns for invoice data (e.g., Date, Vendor, Amount, Invoice Number).

                                                      * Add Google Sheets credentials to n8n.

                                                      * Configure the “Google Sheets” node to append new rows with extracted data.

                                                         5. Email Sending

                                                            * Configure an email sending node (SMTP or Gmail).

                                                            * Define the recipient address (e.g., billing@yourcompany.com).

                                                            * Use dynamic content from OpenAI to personalize the email.

                                                               6. Test the Workflow
